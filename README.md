# TourismAgencyDesktopApp
This project was prepared for Patika+ bootcamp. My aim is to create a functional hotel system.

Let me tell you about the project first. There are 3 different users in our project: manager, employee and customer. We need to prepare 3 different GUIs for these 3 users because each user's purpose and needs for using the program are different. In the project, I used Java SwingGUI and a mysql server running locally.

Let's start with the laziest one;
## The Manager:
I call the manager lazy because the manager only does one thing. That's user management. Managers can see all users, delete users and add employees to the system.

Now let's head to the hardworking ones;
## Employees:
Employees have a lot of work. They can add hotels to the system, add rooms to hotels, edit and delete rooms and hotels. They can also see and delete reservations made by customers.

And finally customers;
## Customers:
Customers can view hotels and their rooms. On the reservation screen, they can view the prices of the rooms dynamically according to the information they provide and they can delete the reservation they made. Also they can sign up and delete their accounts.

And that's it, thank you for reading.
